# Chat_WebApp

This project aimed at developing a real-time chat application using JavaScript for both the front end and back end. The application utilizes RESTful services to facilitate communication between users in a single chat forum. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in various aspects of web development, including server-side scripting, client-side scripting, authentication, and security measures.

## Overview
